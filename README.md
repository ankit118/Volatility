# Volatility 
###Description

Here I am using Mapreduce on a Hadoop environment at CCR to compute the monthly volatility of stocks. Taking data of 2970 stocks on NASDAQ market for 3 years from 01/01/2012 to 12/31/2014 (except holidays, otherwise called trading days).

Goal of the project is to compare the performance of Hadoop on different number of cores and for different dataloads and to improve the running time of MapReduce.
